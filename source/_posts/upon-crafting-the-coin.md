## So where does money come from? There’s a literal answer to this question, but in a more abstract sense, it's tangible value.

In a town sustained by a copper mine, life thrived as long as the mine produced. The city boasted a tavern, a real estate broker, a doctor, and a church, all supported indirectly by the mine's prosperity. However, the economic foundation crumbled when the mine's resources were exhausted. Miners lost their jobs, and local businesses suffered from the lack of spending. The town tried to sustain itself by circulating the remaining money, but the economic activity dwindled with every transaction and the need to import essentials. Eventually, the city could no longer sustain itself and was abandoned, becoming a ghost town.

 **The collective of jobs can be broken down into three groups.**

The first category includes various service industry roles, such as social media managers, bank clerks, politicians, retail employees, the clergy, and attorneys. A solely service-based economy is unviable. Picture a self-contained town populated exclusively by individuals from these professions. Given that every transaction incurs costs, this community would inevitably deplete its resources.

The second category comprises those who directly generate wealth, such as farmers, miners, and manufacturers. They produce tangible value, whether a ton of mined ore, a barrel of oil, or a bushel of harvested apples. This segment of the economy is capable of self-sustenance.

The third category aims to enhance the productivity of the second through technological and efficiency advancements. This includes scientists who develop crops with significantly increased yields and engineers who innovate with tools like a tractor-powered plow instead of traditional methods. While this group alone cannot maintain an economy, their integration with the productive sector significantly boosts wealth generation per capita.

Historically, the majority fell into the second category, directly contributing to the economy's tangible assets. The third category, however, exhibits an exponential growth potential. Initially, their impact might seem minimal, but due to their ability to innovate and build upon past advancements in a manner unlike the other groups, they eventually become pivotal. It's conceivable to envision a scenario where a handful of farmers, leveraging automation and sensor technology, manage vast agricultural expanses. Or perhaps, imagine a future with no human farmers, only machines tending to the fields and other machines repairing those machines ( _although I am not one of the people imagining these, people who haven’t farmed might indeed imagine it, so I include it as an example_ ). Yet, these machines would still be part of the second group, which remains fundamental to any economy.

In my analysis of the top 30 occupations in the U.S. (representing two-thirds of the workforce, based on a broad categorization from bls.gov), I found it necessary to refine the first group for greater precision further. Remarkably, the four most common jobs involve merely transporting items—activities that align with the first group's characteristics.

Breaking down the first category yields:

  * F-M: Those responsible for transporting and handling materials and services, including roles like waiters, retail employees, clerks, drivers, and bankers. 

  * F-E: Individuals dedicated to combating disorder and maintaining order, such as housekeepers, medical professionals, and nurses. 

  * F-B: The orchestrators of operations, including various leadership and directive roles like managers, executives, specialists in multiple fields, financial experts, sales representatives, and administrative personnel.




Teachers posed a unique classification challenge. If we view education as effectively enhancing productivity, akin to manufacturing tractors, teachers belong to the second group, as they contribute to creating more capable individuals. However, if education is perceived merely as a form of supervision or care, akin to services in group 1, they would align with that category. Opting for an optimistic view of education's impact, teachers were placed in the second group.

Furthermore, the broad "Computer Occupations" category doesn't exclusively fit into the third group, characterized by roles that drive innovation and efficiency improvements. However, all computer-related occupations have been allocated to the third group for this analysis.

If we dive deeper and look at the data published by the Bureau of other countries in Europe and Asia, we would see a similar trend where the first category of jobs is increasing at the expense of the second. We cannot live in a world where more people are moving goods around than people are making those same goods.
