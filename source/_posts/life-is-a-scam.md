# Life is a scam

## Life is a profound scam. Although, it's - usually - worth falling for.

Before people call me a pessimist follower of [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer), let me clear up my position. I **do** believe that life is worth living. I would **never** try to convince someone to take his own or another person's life just because he thinks that it’s unworthy of existence. 

But I do have to state that living is a scam, as is [daylight savings time](http://\(https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/6/why-life-is-a-scam-ibaratunde/). In any case, I suggest you keep reading. I think I will find some value in these words.

Let's start by defining a universally acceptable scam.

The US health system (and health systems in general) is a scam. Health expenditures of the average American citizen have gone up 5x in the last 50 years, but the lifespan of Americans has essentially remained the same and has even been declining in the past 4 years.

I know that before 1970, there were two WWs, but I find it hardly relevant to this matter. The usual calculation method is not cohort life expectancy but _period life expectancy_. With period life expectancy, we can remove the unwanted factors, such as wars or pandemics, and make an estimation based on an average year. It is the definition used by most international organizations, including the UN and the World Bank, when reporting ‘life expectancy’ figures.

Although Americans spend more on their health, they end up living roughly the same. One may argue that in life, quality is more important than quantity. Life quality usually translates to a greater satisfaction and happiness index. You have a good quality of life - you are happy.

I wish humanity had more data on human happiness, but we will have to work with what we have. Thanks to [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction), we can see that the percentage of people in the US who say they are happy has decreased dramatically over the last two decades. While Americans spend more to increase their life expectancy and improve their quality of life, they live the same and are less happy. Sounds like a scam to me.

On the contrary, let's take a look at TVs. If you're in your early 20s, like myself, you may remember this.

Do you recall the stark contrast between the television technology of the past and the advanced models available today? The prevalent static interference (I have tinnitus now, so it’s all the same to me), the subpar image resolution, and the inferior speaker quality.

That's a 2021 8K TV from Samsung. Which one would you choose to game or watch Netflix? 

Features and design of modern TVs have immensely improved in the past 20 years. We went from a noisy radioactive box to a silent piece of glass and metal.

Consumer electronic products appear to be the counter definition of a scam. Given our empirical definition of what may consist of a scam, let’s take a look at why life might fall under the description of one.

The 3 fundamentals of life are:

a) survival

b) reproduction

c) evolution

The key to thriving primarily hinges on fostering companionship and nurturing relationships. Interestingly, these two elements serve a dual purpose: they are both the objectives we strive for and the rewards we receive in that pursuit. 

Trends in tracking loneliness are [discouraging](https://www.economist.com/international/2018/09/01/loneliness-is-a-serious-public-health-problem), posing a very profound loneliness problem that has now reached an [epidemic state.](https://ourworldindata.org/loneliness-epidemic)

Humankind is putting so much effort into relationships and companionship that platforms worth billions of dollars have been developed in the last decade to bring people from all around the globe together. Yet, the data indicates that the problem has increased in intensity quite unexpectedly.

Nature has a system of sustenance. The reward of successfully satisfying the requirement is fulfilling the three fundamental requirements for life. It's a deep loop. 

Although we seem to manage to reproduce, evolve, and survive, the general observation is that relationships and partners are failing us. Why is the loop leaking?

Life is indeed a scam. We're giving so much effort for survival, reproduction, and evolution, and yet we are somehow robbed of true relationships and companionships. We are expending a great deal to gain very little in return.
