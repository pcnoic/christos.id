# The hallucination of hands-off volunteerism

## People are comforting their moral and ethical consciences while being misguided by big corporations and personalities whose only goal is to increase engagement.

People want to help to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. Yet, people are also lazy. That combination gives birth to **the hallucination of hands-off volunteerism.**

Wildfires, terrorism, earthquakes, hurricanes, and nuclear accidents are prevalent. These events have, sometimes, an impact on residential areas, destroying houses and injuring or killing people.

Our phones are equipped with state-of-the-art cameras and wireless antennas. Device and service affordability and availability made them commonplace in pockets of people of any income.

Platforms were built on top of the World Wide Web, promising to democratize society by granting a loud voice to everyone. Instant picture-sharing features in these platforms gave users a powerful way of participating and shaping the commons through consumption or production. Behind these advancements lies the noble struggle of people to provide, yet blended with innate human laziness and fear of being involved. 

What I’ve come to observe, though, is that while being vocal in social media has a certain degree of political or societal landscaping, it tends to create echo chambers that distract from issues that should have also been in the spotlight.

I tend to think that the phenomenon boils down to:

  * false sense of involvement as a result of the number of people receiving your message

  * innate willingness to help

  * laziness

  * peer pressure




I came to those conclusions thinking about how:

  * talking or writing **rarely** has the same effect as acting unless you are a prominent figure who’s an established or popular thinker 

  * your voice/writings are **a drop in an ocean** of voices/writings that do not align thus having minimal impact

  * people are most likely a **sink** , not a **source**

  * people don’t have a large enough audience and even if they do, they rarely care if there’s no gossip, nudity or money involved.




 **Yet, the internet is a valuable activism tool that** :

  * requires people that are willing to act by forming communities and acting

  * is best way to transfer information




So, if you have to be an activist use the Internet as a tool to build solutions or form communities.
