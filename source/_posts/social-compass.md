## A manual for steering through the vast sea of social media platforms on the internet.

Here are 30 social media platforms with more than 100.000.000 active users as of February 2nd, 2022. Their features overlap and thus make each other redundant.

Redundancy is a good thing when you're worried about the availability of a system. In layman's terms, social media platforms are the operating system of modern regimes.

Montesquieu used the phrase "trias politica" to describe the separation of powers in a state. Those are the legislative, executive, and judicial branches that (must) act independently of each other.

I am inclined to believe that in the next decade, "trias politica" will be replaced by social media.

Coming back to the redundancy of a system, having multiple social media platforms to ensure that society can continue its operation when one of them is compromised is good.

As the author of [Normal Accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_Accidents) noted, the redundancy decreased reliability. We have managed to over-expand social media platforms and are now left with complex systems prone to manipulation and extremism. Redundancy has created a shrinking of responsibility among workers, eventually creating a system that operates at higher speeds but less safely.

Different social media platforms provide similar tools but appeal to certain workers' tastes. From stupidity to vanity, from egomania to a facade of inspiration, there is a place for everyone.

These platforms exploit users to increase their participation. Yet, their own decay is relatively easy to predict.

######  _where_`n` _is the number of components,_`pi` _is the probability of failure of one component, and_`p` _is the probability of a system failure._

There is a direct relationship between the number of components a system has and the probability of it failing. 

We should all learn how to swim. Our platforms are failing us.
