## Not all companies are created equal and why the notion of creating value to succeed is wrong if you want to make it as a company.

**Apr 25, 2024**

When I think of a wonderland, one key aspect of this place is that companies profit from the value they’re adding (we can even accept the companies who make money by transferring value) to the world. 

They’re not always making the world a better place. An arms company isn’t making the world a better place, as most of the time, the BMs are killing innocent people. But it’s adding value in helping whichever government or terrorist group achieve its political or ideological goals.

Companies that don't operate on a value-add basis are scams. Yet, perception is reality. If you define success as short-term shareholder value, you don’t have to build a company that creates value. You don’t even need a product. What separates the real companies from the scams is telling the truth, both to themselves and, more importantly, to the world.

Cruise is an interesting example. If they were to tell the truth in 2016, GM wouldn’t have bought them for $1B. Later, it was discovered that they were losing $5M daily, now coming out of GM’s pockets. 

They are still promising profitability, but the[ data suggests otherwise](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/15/cruise-looks-like-gm-latest-failed-bet-on-trendy-venture.html), and everyone who wants to be honest with themselves knows they never will be profitable.

Now, Elon promises that L5 is a “few months away” [every few months.](https://www.google.com/search?q=every+time+elon+musk+promised+level+5&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGR1086GR1086&oq=every+time+elon+musk+promised+level+5&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDcyNjlqMGo0qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Yet Tesla’s market cap is three times as big as a small country’s GDP. 

Communication is not the vessel of truth; it’s the medium to desirable outcomes.

Since we talked about value-add companies, I think a useful metric to judge a company’s success is value-subtraction. It usually works both ways and it measures the amount of resources that you’ve funneled into your thing and how many moats you destroyed. In its most simplistic form, you can calculate it through _VSP_ = _f_ ( _RM_ ​) where _f_ is a function that defines how the ratio of moats to resources diminishes value.

Products and companies are usually intertwined in people’s minds, [and they’re usually interwoven in founders’ caffeine-fueled brains, too. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kH6qa2LFO4)

Don’t have a product? It doesn’t really matter. You can use the company as your product. Go out and hire dozens of marketing folk and shill. Produce company swag, buy coffee machines and make TikTok videos of what an awesome company you are. If you don’t have $10M to throw on a new office, use Photoshop.

Don’t have a product? Who cares? Hire recruiters and let them shill. Now you’re growing so fast and the markets think you’re the next big thing. It’s only logical; you have a guy to welcome other guys in the office. 

Don’t have a product? It definitely doesn't matter now. Sell it. Close. You’re wasting others’ time, not yours; yours is compensated. Building a product should come after selling it. The guys that are welcomed every morning from your welcome guy will build you the product.

Still don’t have a product? Fuck, you forget easily. The company is the product. You need to do advertising. Any good Instagram ads or TikTok reels I can see? Bought any huge mailing lists? Are your website heat maps looking like Europe in the summer?

It’s okay if you need money. You’re everywhere, so people know you. They knew SBF and Adam Neumann before; now they know you. You are legitimate, and you can always get more investment or ZIRP credit. You are still the next big thing.

It’s a disgusting game to play, and it, if you’re honest, will make you feel like proper shite. At least, you’ll buy a yacht. But, Bezos will buy a bigger one.
