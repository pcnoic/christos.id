# Social media are refined online brothels

## I don’t want to waste my time. Become another casualty of society. I’ll never fall in line. Become another victim of your conformity and back down. – Fat Lip, Sum 41

The subtitle of this post is a song from 2001. I was two years old. I have a picture from that era where I slam a keyboard.

Have you ever been in a brothel? I haven't. I find them to be too honest for my liking. Real relationships are dishonest and theatrical, and my taste has been irreversibly adapted to fulfill white-collar society’s bidding.

But I know people that frequent. They all tell me one thing: the employees are going to do what they have to, you are going to pretend or really **like** it, and in the end, you will hate them for what they are and what they do, but they won’t care because you will keep coming back for more.

You keep saying to yourself that you're just going there out of curiosity, to keep up with the latest trend, or simply to have fun. In fact, you go there for pleasure and because you’re addicted.

The winner is the owner of the brothel.
