# How to choose co-founders

## Spotting talent with shared values and dealing with noise.

I've dedicated a significant amount of time talking to people and trying to identify talent that might end up in building something useful. I started my career as an engineer in a small company, working primarily in the intersection of software and systems. As my interest in building a company grew over the years, I had to acquire other skills, enabling me to do experiments, validate ideas, and build the first few iterations of a product.

Once you dive in the ecosystem, you'll notice a diverse range of participants. Among them are many who may not possess technical expertise—those who are more about ideation than creation.

There are probably more people in the world with ideas about what the internet should look like than people with opinions on what a good steak should taste. This abundance of ideas is a trait of the startup ecosystem. So, brace yourself for a constant influx of concepts and suggestions—it's a fundamental part of navigating the ecosystem and the most annoying. Time is your most valuable asset, and you should be careful where you spend it.

Some of these people might end up becoming your future co-founders, with whom you will spend a lot of time hunting down customers, having difficult conversations, and trying to produce value for yourself, your customers, and your investors.

So don’t look away immediately. Investigate and judge.

#### Rule #1: de-gender everyone

The foundational principle in selecting a potential partner for a startup, whether the idea originates from you or the other person or is a shared vision that emerged independently before your paths crossed, is to prioritize professional compatibility over personal attributes unrelated to job performance. When evaluating a potential collaborator, the goal is to see beyond superficial characteristics, focusing instead on their intellectual contributions, work ethic, skills, and how their vision aligns with yours.

To achieve this objectivity, one might adopt a mental strategy of perceiving every individual encountered in a professional setting not as defined by their gender or appearance but as an artificial intelligence system. A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. A Terminator. This perspective emphasizes assessing their intellectual capacity, what they communicate, their approach, attitude, and abilities, rather than physical attributes or other non-relevant factors. The concept here is to "desex" the evaluation process, ensuring that judgments are based solely on professional merit.

De-gendering your partner will help you avoid the animalistic tendencies you have to judge people based on their smell, appearance, or voice. 

#### Rule #2: alignment

Alignment has become a pivotal contemporary concept, frequently considered valuable in many contexts. However, alignment takes on a more personal and foundational meaning when choosing a business partner. It involves ensuring that you share a common ethos, understand each other's boundaries, and agree on what is considered off-limits.

It dictates how you will handle business challenges, make decisions that affect your business, employees, founders, and investors, and navigate ethical dilemmas. A lack of alignment can lead to insurmountable conflicts, as individuals typically find it difficult to compromise their deeply held values. Conflicts arising from misaligned values can impose significant strains on both personal relationships and the business itself.

#### Rule #3: working together

Sharing a similar work ethic and mentality towards tackling tasks is paramount. It doesn’t necessarily mean you must work the same hours or solve an equal number of problems. The essence of this rule is the mutual comfort level with hard work and, critically, the willingness to engage in tasks outside one's area of expertise.

Reflecting on personal experiences, I've seen promising business relationships falter when both parties were required to venture into unknown territories at critical junctures, such as product launches or deal closures. Success in a startup often hinges on one's ability to "embrace the suck" — to be willing to fail at unfamiliar tasks initially, enjoy the learning process, and eventually find or invent solutions to novel problems.

Startups demand a founder who can thrive in uncertainty, be willing to absorb information rapidly, fail, seek advice, and persist until the obstacle is overcome. A partner who shares this mentality is invaluable. If you or your potential partner are not on this wavelength, embracing the discomfort of tackling unknown problems, the partnership will unlikely be productive in the long term.

Complementarity in skills should not equate to avoiding responsibility for specific tasks. While it's natural for individuals to excel in different areas, startups demand that both partners are willing to learn from each other, stepping outside their comfort zones to ensure all aspects of the business are covered. 

A team where each member strives to learn and adapt, rather than merely relying on others to fill gaps, will invariably be stronger and more cohesive. In the end, a startup with founders who each evolve to understand all facets of the business — including technical aspects, even if they're not developers — is more likely to succeed.

#### Rule #4: conversations 

Everything between partners should be straightforward. Ideally, conversations should occur once, with all participants fully understanding the topics, decisions, and any action items arising. This approach avoids repetition and ensures that once a consensus is reached, it's not revisited with changing opinions or doubts in the future.

Communication efficiency directly impacts a startup's agility and ability to make decisions rapidly. No matter how data-driven or well-intentioned, spending excessive time on discussions can lead to missed opportunities. 

You should be able to discuss all critical topics swiftly. Most of the time, this will benefit you rather than disadvantage you, even if you make the wrong decision.

The cornerstone of a successful business partnership is respect—not merely treating each other well, but a profound appreciation for what each partner brings to the table. This respect transcends courteous interaction; it is about valuing the other person's contributions, ethics, and the unique qualities they get in the partnership. 

If there's one takeaway from this discussion, it should be the importance of building companies on a foundation of deep respect for your colleagues. Work with the ones that you'd be happy to work for.
